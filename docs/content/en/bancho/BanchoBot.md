## BanchoBot

BanchoBot is an online chat bot made for osu! that assists people in the in-game chat by announcing game-related messages and responding to certain commands. It was programmed by [Echo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/431) and is the provider of the [Bancho IRC](/wiki/Community/Internet_Relay_Chat). 
It also has its own [osu! profile](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3) and [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/banchoboat).

### Commands

BanchoBot responds to player commands through specific messages typed in chat. All BanchoBot commands begin with an exclamation mark (`!`) and are followed by the case-insensitive name of the command you want (with no space between). These commands can be used in chat channels and through private messages with BanchoBot. However, if you use a BanchoBot command in public chat, other users will not see it and the response will be displayed inside a private message from BanchoBot.

To get a list of all BanchoBot commands, use the command `!help`.
