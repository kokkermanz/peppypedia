<p hidden> I am aware of the multiple grammar issues present in this article, as it was somewhat rushed and I'm too lazy right now to be bothered (slightly because I didn't sleep at all last night).</p>

## Interent Relay Chat

Internet Relay Chat, better known and mostly abbreviated as IRC, is a text-based chat protocol first introduced in 1988.[^1] The chat protocol used in Bancho is IRC and can be connected to via an IRC client such as HexChat.[^2]

### Connecting to osu!Bancho:

___

- Server: `cho.ppy.sh` or `irc.ppy.sh`

- Port: `6667`
